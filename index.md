Hi - currently I am a 1st year CS master‚Äôs student at Columbia University, specializing in Machine Learning. I am passionate about creating a **‚ú®positive disruption‚ú® in making AI trustworthy, safer, and fairer for various users in various contexts**. You can reach me at cp3227@columbia.edu.

My interest in **Explainable and Robust ML** was fostered through my extensive research experience at Boeing, where I was involved in ***Automated Visual Inspection*** and ***Autonomous Flight*** projects that emphasizes both performance and explainability of AI models. This research resulted in a US patent pending, ICCV 2021 accepted 1st author paper. I have also closely collaborated with Boeing Directors and cross functional teams in different time zones to establish a new Boeing R&D center (BKETC) in South Korea from scratch. In addition, I have demonstrated leadership and project management skills where I have shaped and managed many of Boeing's research portfolio projects and milestones.

I have leveraged my academic background to better understand and navigate not only the research problem itself, but also the entailing business impacts, opportunities, and risks which helped me approach a problem with a holistic perspective. I believe such skills and unique experiences differentiate me from other engineers and researchers.

I was an undergraduate Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS) Scholarship scholar, and currently a Korean Government Study Abroad Scholarship scholar.

## Research Interest

My research interest lies in **enabling trustworthy and safe autonomous vehicles through Explainable AI**. Specifically, I want to research methodologies to understand why the model has made a particular decision by extracting human comprehensible information from the black box model. I am fascinated how Explainable AI can identify inherent biases and out-of-distributions, while shedding light on ‚Äòwhy‚Äô the system is behaving as it does through visualizations, words, and metrics. Ultimately, I envision Detect-and-Avoid systems for Disruptive Mobility to leverage robust Explainable AI on multimodal data. I believe rethinking the entire architecture principle to prioritize safety and embedding trustworthy mechanisms for preventing failures is essential, which is why my research interest has tremendous social value.

Just like Boeing's motto _‚ÄúThe Future is Built Here‚Äù‚úàÔ∏è_, I do novel research to push boundaries of AI.   
  
  

## Hobbies

<img align="right" src="assets/img/perth.jpg" width="270" height="360"> 

Sports-wise, I love swimming and roller blading. I have played the clarinet for 15+ years and I‚Äôm very fond of the dulcet and mellow sound of this beautiful woodwind instrument. I also love traveling and appreciating diversity in the cities I go to. Here's one of my favorite photo from Perth, Australia when I went to SIGGRAPH ASIA 2019 as a student volunteer. Can you see the countless shades of blue? üåäüåä
