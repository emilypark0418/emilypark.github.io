## Intro

**Currently an Advanced Technologist (Data Analyst) at Boeing Research & Technology (BR&T) AI Team**. </br>

Just like Boeing's motto _‚ÄúThe Future is Built Here‚Äù‚úàÔ∏è_, my team and I do novel research to push the boundaries of AI. I am involved in projects related to <ins>**automated visual inspection** and **human action recognition for autonomous vehicles**</ins>, cherishing every moment of learning, researching, and having fun with my fantastic colleagues.

I joined Boeing in January of 2018 as part of the **International Business Internship Program (IBIP)**, where I relocated to **Seattle, WA** for 6 months to work in **BR&T Global R&D Strategy (GRADS)** Team. I returned to South Korea after the internship to finish my last year of university, and during my senior year, I worked as a part-time intern to help a director establish Boeing's 7th International Research Center in Seoul, South Korea. That research center has been named _**"Boeing Korea Engineering & Technology Center (BKETC)"**_ and I subsequently joined full time there after my graduation! It has been quite a journey.  


## Research Interest

My research interest lies in **enabling trustworthy and safe autonomous vehicles through Explainable AI**. Specifically, I want to research methodologies to understand why the model has made a particular decision by extracting human comprehensible information from the black box model. I am fascinated how Explainable AI can identify inherent biases and out-of-distributions, while shedding light on ‚Äòwhy‚Äô the system is behaving as it does through visualizations, words, and metrics. Ultimately, I envision Detect-and-Avoid systems for disruptive mobility to leverage robust Explainable AI on multimodal data. Designing novel ML approaches to nudge  models to focus on more relevant & appropriate features will be a step toward much sounder and cogent safety decisions in all domains.

## Hobbies

Sports-wise, I love swimming and roller blading. I have played the clarinet for 10+ years and I‚Äôm very fond of the dulcet and mellow sound of this beautiful woodwind instrument. I also love traveling and appreciating diversity in the cities I go to. Here's one of my favorite photo from Perth, Australia when I went to SIGGRAPH ASIA 2019 as a student volunteer. Can you see the countless shades of blue? üåäüåä
