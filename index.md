Just like Boeing's motto _‚ÄúThe Future is Built Here‚Äù‚úàÔ∏è_, my team and I do novel research to push boundaries of AI. I am involved in projects related to <ins>**automated visual inspection** and **human action recognition for autonomous vehicles**</ins>, cherishing every moment of learning, researching, and having fun with my fantastic colleagues.

I joined Boeing in January of 2018 as part of the **International Business Internship Program (IBIP)**, where I relocated to **Seattle, WA** for 6 months to work in **BR&T Global R&D Strategy (GRADS)** Team. I returned to South Korea after the internship to finish my last year of university, and during my senior year, I worked as a part-time intern to help a director establish Boeing's 7th International Research Center in Seoul, South Korea. That research center has been named _**"Boeing Korea Engineering & Technology Center (BKETC)"**_ and I subsequently joined full time there after my graduation! It has been quite a journey.

## Research Interest

My research interest lies in **enabling trustworthy and safe autonomous vehicles through Explainable AI**. Specifically, I want to research methodologies to understand why the model has made a particular decision by extracting human comprehensible information from the black box model. I am fascinated how Explainable AI can identify inherent biases and out-of-distributions, while shedding light on ‚Äòwhy‚Äô the system is behaving as it does through visualizations, words, and metrics. Ultimately, I envision Detect-and-Avoid systems for disruptive mobility to leverage robust Explainable AI on multimodal data. I believe rethinking the entire architecture principle to prioritize safety and embedding trustworthy mechanisms for preventing failures is essential, which is why my research interest has tremendous social value.


Keywords: Explainable AI ¬∑ Visual Explanation ¬∑ Resilient AI ¬∑ AI for Safety ¬∑ AI for Good

## Hobbies

<img align="right" src="assets/img/perth.jpg" width="260" height="310"> 

Sports-wise, I love swimming and roller blading. I have played the clarinet for 15+ years and I‚Äôm very fond of the dulcet and mellow sound of this beautiful woodwind instrument. I also love traveling and appreciating diversity in the cities I go to. Here's one of my favorite photo from Perth, Australia when I went to SIGGRAPH ASIA 2019 as a student volunteer. Can you see the countless shades of blue? üåäüåä
