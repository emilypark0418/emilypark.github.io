## About Me

Hi, I’m currently working as a Data Analyst at Boeing Research & Technology AI team. I’d like to think that “The Future is Built Here”✈️ and am cherishing every moment with my fantastic teammates. I am involved in AI projects related to automated visual inspection and human action recognition for autonomous vehicles.

## Research Interest

My interests lie in **Resilient Intelligence for Ambient Safety**, which was fostered while working in aerospace for 2+ years. Specifically, I want to research methodologies to understand why the model has made a particular decision by extracting human comprehensible information from the black box model. Designing novel ML approaches to nudge the model to focus on more relevant & appropriate features will be a step toward much sounder and cogent safety decisions. Ultimately, I hope to build a smart safety ecosystem that self-perpetuates and improves through adaptive AI.

## Education

I graduated from Yonsei University, with a B.A. in Business Administration and a B.S. in Computer Science. I also have a Samsung Convergence Software Course (SCSC) certificate. In school, I was involved in IT Business Strategy club projects for product strategy of SK Telecom’s AI assistant Nugu, which is a Korean version of Alexa or Google Home. I also played keyboard for my class band in my freshman year.

## Hobbies

Sports-wise, I love swimming and roller blading. I have played the clarinet for 10+ years and I’m very fond of the dulcet sound of this beautiful woodwind instrument.
