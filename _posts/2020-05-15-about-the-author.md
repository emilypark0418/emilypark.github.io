## About Me

<img align="left" src="../assets/img/profile.jpg" width="160" height="210"> 

Hi, I‚Äôm currently working as a Data Analyst at Boeing Research & Technology (BR&T) AI team. 
Just like Boeing's motto **‚ÄúThe Future is Built Here‚Äù‚úàÔ∏è**, my team and I are doing novel research to push the boundaries of AI.  I am involved in AI projects related to **automated visual inspection** and **human action recognition for autonomous vehicles**. I am cherishing every moment of learning, researching, and having fun with my fantastic colleagues.

I joined Boeing in January of 2018 as part of the International Business Internship Program (IBIP), where I relocated to Seattle, WA for 6 months to work in BR&T Global R&D Strategy (GRADS) Team. I returned to South Korea after the internship to finish my last year of university, and during my senior year, I worked as a part-time intern to help a director establish Boeing's 7th International Research Center in Seoul, South Korea. That research center has been named "Boeing Korea Engineering & Technology Center (BKETC)" and I subsequently joined full time there after my graduation! It has been quite a journey.  


## Research Interest

My research interests lie in **Resilient Intelligence for Ambient Safety**, which my 2+ aerospace industry experience has fostered. Specifically, I want to research methodologies to understand why the model has made a particular decision by extracting human comprehensible information from the black box model. Designing novel ML approaches to nudge the model to focus on more relevant & appropriate features will be a step toward much sounder and cogent safety decisions. Ultimately, I hope to build a smart safety ecosystem that self-perpetuates and improves through adaptive AI.

## Education

I graduated from **Yonsei University**, with a **B.A. in Business Administration** and a **B.S. in Computer Science**. I also have a Samsung Convergence Software Course (SCSC) certificate. In school, I was also involved in an IT Business Strategy club project for product strategy of SK Telecom‚Äôs AI assistant Nugu, which is a Korean version of Alexa / Google Home. I also played keyboard for my class band in my freshman year.

## Hobbies

Sports-wise, I love swimming and roller blading. I have played the clarinet for 10+ years and I‚Äôm very fond of the dulcet sound of this beautiful woodwind instrument. I also love traveling and appreciating diversity in the cities I go to. Here's one of my favorite photo from Perth, Australia when I went to SIGGRAPH ASIA 2019 as a student volunteer. Can you see the countless shades of blue? üåäüåä
