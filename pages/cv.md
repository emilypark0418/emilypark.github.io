      * Researched methods to resolve Attention Branch Network’s unstable visual explanations that sometimes generate attention maps on defect images’ background, instead of the target defect itself
      * Ran experiments on public surface datasets to build a comprehensive ML package and pipeline, focusing on improving image classification, semantic segmentation, and robust visual explanation performance
      * Developed 3D defect recreation program using ThreeJS and Constructive Solid Geometry library to enable customized modifications to various standard geometries and airplane models for data augmentation
    * <ins>**Action Recognition**</ins>
      * Created interactive 3D simulator for testing algorithm performance through visualization
    * Tools: Cuda, PyTorch, OpenCV, Javascript (ThreeJS and Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) library), Redis, HTML, CSS

* **Student Community Facebook Page Post Analysis** (May 2016 – June 2016)
	* Analyzed 3060 posts from a student community Facebook page using Graph API, access token, and csv library in Python. Text-mined keywords to identify the students’ general mood fluctuations over the time of day
	* Evaluated the lead time for a post to be publicly posted after being submitted to the administrator through Google Docs, using time stamp parsing to verify the validity of the page’s ‘72-hour Policy’ for workload management

* **Lemon Car Market Analysis** (April 2017 – May 2017)
	* Analyzed Lemon Car data from Kaggle with various classification algorithms, classification matrixes, and lift charts to identify the most salient car features that determine lemon cars with the highest accuracy
	* Determined car dealer’s optimal strategy to achieve highest profit using profit chart, based on the assumption that the dealer trades off reputation and money for every lemon he sells, and that reputation can be converted to money

* **Mileage Class Enrollment Problem Project** (Mar 2016 – June 2016)
	* Formulated optimal class enrollment strategy in the mileage-based class enrollment system for Yonsei students
